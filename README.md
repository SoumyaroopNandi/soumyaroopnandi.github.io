## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **recent Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science** from the **University of Southern California (USC)**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Deep Learning**. My doctoral research at the **USC Information Sciences Institute** focused on developing **state-space** and **information-theoretic deep learning models** for *AI-generated image forgery detection*, *generative model fingerprinting*, and *vision-language understanding*.

I bring **hands-on experience across the full AI stack** — from **model design and optimization** (*SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, CNNs, Transformers*) to **data curation**, **multimodal learning**, and **large-scale deployment**. My projects bridge vision, language, and generative modeling, with applications in **biomedical imaging**, **digital content integrity**, and **trustworthy AI systems**.

Over the years, I have gained **extensive experience** in *AI-driven image analysis*, *generative model forensics*, and *visual-language alignment*, spanning *forgery detection*, *diffusion modeling*, *self-supervised learning*, and *anomaly detection*. My research integrates **semantic understanding** with **low-level artifact reasoning** to advance *explainable and robust visual intelligence*.

Beyond academia, I have **industry experience** at **ABB Robotics** and **ON Semiconductor**, applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and reinforcement learning to real-world automation systems. I also worked at the **Kansas Geological Survey** and the **Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets**, developing **signal and image processing pipelines** for radar and seismic data.

During my **Master’s in Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Kansas**, my thesis — *“Robust Object Tracking and Adaptive Detection for Auto Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles”* — explored **object tracking**, **motion estimation**, and **adaptive detection** using classical computer vision and signal processing techniques. This research formed the foundation for my later work in **deep learning** and **generative AI**.

With a strong foundation in **AI model development**, **generative systems**, and **applied computer vision**, I am passionate about building **scalable**, **reliable**, and **interpretable AI solutions** that drive innovation in *visual intelligence* and *generative trustworthiness*.
