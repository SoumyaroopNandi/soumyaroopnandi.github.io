## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Ph.D. graduate in **Computer Science** from the **University of Southern California (USC)**, where my research focused on  
**Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Image Forensics** — developing state-space and information-theoretic models for detecting generative image forgeries.

Before my Ph.D., I completed an **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** from the **University of Kansas**, where my thesis explored object tracking and adaptive detection for autonomous UAV navigation.  
I’ve also worked at **ABB Robotics**, **ON Semiconductor**, and **Kansas Geological Survey**, applying computer vision and signal processing to real-world systems.
