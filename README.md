## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a <strong>recent Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science</strong> from the <strong>University of Southern California (USC)</strong>, specializing in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-NM0rJIU_AC&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dr. Prem Natarajan</strong></a> at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>USC Information Sciences Institute</strong></a>, where my doctoral research focused on developing <strong>state-space</strong> and <strong>information-theoretic deep learning models</strong> for AI-generated image forgery detection, generative model fingerprinting, and vision-language understanding. My <strong>Ph.D. thesis</strong>, titled 
<a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/238670cc641260d59c87daec87717a51/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" 
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">
  <em>“Context-Aware Semantic Forgery Detection in Biomedical and Natural Images”</em>
</a>., explored the integration of semantic and non-semantic cues for robust manipulation detection.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I bring <strong>hands-on experience across the full AI stack</strong> — from <strong>model design and optimization</strong> (<em>SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, CNNs, Transformers</em>) to <strong>data curation</strong>, <strong>multimodal learning</strong>, and <strong>large-scale deployment</strong>. My projects bridge <strong>vision</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, and <strong>generative modeling</strong>, with applications in <strong>biomedical imaging</strong>, <strong>digital content integrity</strong>, and <strong>trustworthy AI systems</strong>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in <strong>AI-driven image analysis</strong>, <strong>generative model forensics</strong>, and <strong>visual-language alignment</strong>, spanning forgery detection, diffusion modeling, self-supervised learning, and anomaly detection. My research further encompasses <strong>image manipulation detection and localization</strong> — including splicing, copy-move, inpainting, and enhancement forgeries — as well as <strong>deepfake detection</strong> and <strong>fingerprinting of generative synthetic images</strong> from GANs, VAEs, Flows, and Diffusion Models. I am also interested in <strong>scientific integrity of research documents</strong>, <strong>document visual question answering</strong>, and <strong>zero-shot semantic segmentation</strong>, along with <strong>image description</strong>, <strong>captioning</strong>, <strong>scene-graph generation</strong>, <strong>image repurpose detection</strong>, and <strong>visual question answering</strong>. These directions collectively aim to advance <strong>explainable, robust, and generalizable visual intelligence systems</strong> that reason jointly over semantic and non-semantic cues.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Beyond academia, I have <strong>industry experience</strong> at <a href="https://www.abb.com/global/en/areas/robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ABB Robotics</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ON Semiconductor</strong></a>, applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and reinforcement learning to real-world automation systems. I also worked at the <a href="https://kgs.ku.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kansas Geological Survey</strong></a> and the <a href="https://cresis.ku.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets</strong></a>, developing signal and image processing pipelines for radar and seismic data. During my <strong>Master’s in Electrical Engineering</strong> at the <strong>University of Kansas</strong>, I completed my thesis under <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I_5aoAwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Dr. Richard Wang</strong></a> titled <a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/entities/publication/f6aa75d9-cbcc-47a4-b6ef-545c704740e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>“Robust Object Tracking and Adaptive Detection for Auto Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles”</em></a>, which explored object tracking, motion estimation, and adaptive detection using classical computer vision and signal processing techniques — forming the foundation for my later research in deep learning and generative AI.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With a strong foundation in <strong>AI model development</strong>, <strong>generative systems</strong>, and <strong>applied computer vision</strong>, I am passionate about building <strong>scalable</strong> and <strong>interpretable AI solutions</strong> that drive innovation in <strong>visual intelligence</strong> and <strong>generative trustworthiness</strong>.
