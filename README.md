## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

I am a **recent Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science** from the **University of Southern California (USC)**, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Computer Vision**, and **Deep Learning**. I was advised by [**Dr. Prem Natarajan**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-NM0rJIU_AC&hl=en) at the [**USC Information Sciences Institute**](https://www.isi.edu/), where my doctoral research focused on developing **state-space** and **information-theoretic deep learning models** for AI-generated image forgery detection, generative model fingerprinting, and vision-language understanding.  
My **Ph.D. thesis**, titled *“Context-Aware Semantic Forgery Detection in Biomedical and Natural Images,”* explored the integration of semantic and non-semantic cues for robust manipulation detection.

I bring **hands-on experience across the full AI stack** — from **model design and optimization** (*SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, CNNs, Transformers*) to **data curation**, **multimodal learning**, and **large-scale deployment**. My projects bridge **vision**, **language**, and **generative modeling**, with applications in **biomedical imaging**, **digital content integrity**, and **trustworthy AI systems**.

Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in **AI-driven image analysis**, **generative model forensics**, and **visual-language alignment**, spanning forgery detection, diffusion modeling, self-supervised learning, and anomaly detection.  
My research further encompasses **image manipulation detection and localization** — including *splicing, copy-move, inpainting,* and *enhancement forgeries* — as well as **deepfake detection** and **fingerprinting of generative synthetic images** from *GANs, VAEs, Flows,* and *Diffusion Models.*  
I am also interested in **scientific integrity of research documents**, **document visual question answering**, and **zero-shot semantic segmentation**, along with **image description**, **captioning**, **scene-graph generation**, **image repurpose detection**, and **visual question answering**.  
These directions collectively aim to advance **explainable, robust, and generalizable visual intelligence systems** that reason jointly over semantic and non-semantic cues.

Beyond academia, I have **industry experience** at [**ABB Robotics**](https://www.abb.com/global/en/areas/robotics) and [**ON Semiconductor**](https://www.onsemi.com/), applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and reinforcement learning to real-world automation systems.  
I also worked at the [**Kansas Geological Survey**](https://kgs.ku.edu/) and the [**Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets**](https://cresis.ku.edu/), developing signal and image processing pipelines for radar and seismic data.  
During my **Master’s in Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Kansas**, I completed my thesis under [**Dr. Richard Wang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I_5aoAwAAAAJ&hl=en), titled  
*“[Robust Object Tracking and Adaptive Detection for Auto Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/entities/publication/f6aa75d9-cbcc-47a4-b6ef-545c704740e5)”* — exploring object tracking, motion estimation, and adaptive detection using classical computer vision and signal processing techniques.  
This work formed the foundation for my later research in deep learning and generative AI.

With a strong foundation in **AI model development**, **generative systems**, and **applied computer vision**, I am passionate about building **scalable** and **interpretable AI solutions** that drive innovation in **visual intelligence** and **generative trustworthiness**.
