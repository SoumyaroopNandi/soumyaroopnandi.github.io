## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science** from the **University of Southern California (USC)**, where my research focused on **Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Image Forensics** — developing state-space and information-theoretic models for detecting generative image forgeries.

Before my Ph.D., I earned an **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** from the **University of Kansas**, where my thesis explored object tracking and adaptive detection for autonomous UAV navigation.  

Beyond academia, I have worked at **ABB Robotics**, **ON Semiconductor**, and the **Kansas Geological Survey**, applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and signal processing to real-world automation and sensing systems.
