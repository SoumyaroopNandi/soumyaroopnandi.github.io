  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science from the University of Southern California (USC),
    specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. I was advised by
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X-NM0rJIU_AC&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Dr. Prem Natarajan</a> at the
    <a href="https://www.isi.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      USC Information Sciences Institute
    </a>, where my doctoral research focused on developing state-space and information-theoretic
    deep learning models for AI-generated image forgery detection, generative model fingerprinting,
    and vision-language understanding. My Ph.D. thesis, titled
    <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/238670cc641260d59c87daec87717a51/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      “Context-Aware Semantic Forgery Detection in Biomedical and Natural Images” </a>, explored the integration of semantic and non-semantic cues for robust manipulation detection.
  </p>

  <p>
    I bring hands-on experience across the full AI stack — from model design and optimization (SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, CNNs, Transformers)
    to data curation, multimodal learning, and large-scale deployment. My projects bridge vision, language, and generative modeling,
    with applications in biomedical imaging, content integrity, and trustworthy AI systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in AI-driven image analysis, generative model forensics, and visual-language alignment,
    spanning forgery detection, diffusion modeling, self-supervised learning, and anomaly detection. My research further encompasses
    image manipulation detection and localization — including splicing, copy-move, inpainting, and enhancement forgeries — as well as
    deepfake detection and fingerprinting of generative synthetic images from GANs, VAEs, flows, and diffusion models. I am also
    interested in the scientific integrity of research documents, document visual question answering, and zero-shot semantic segmentation,
    along with image description, captioning, scene-graph generation, image repurpose detection, and visual question answering.
    These directions collectively aim to advance explainable, robust, and generalizable visual intelligence systems that reason jointly
    over semantic and non-semantic cues.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond academia, I have industry experience at
    <a href="https://www.abb.com/global/en/areas/robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABB Robotics</a> and
    <a href="https://www.onsemi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ON Semiconductor</a>, applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and reinforcement learning
    to real-world automation systems. I also worked at the
    <a href="https://kgs.ku.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kansas Geological Survey</a> and the
    <a href="https://cresis.ku.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets</a>, developing signal
    and image processing pipelines for radar and seismic data. During my Master’s in Electrical Engineering at the University of Kansas,
    I completed my thesis under
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I_5aoAwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Richard Wang</a> titled
    <a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/entities/publication/f6aa75d9-cbcc-47a4-b6ef-545c704740e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      “Robust Object Tracking and Adaptive Detection for Auto Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles”
    </a>, which explored object tracking, motion estimation, and adaptive detection using classical computer vision and signal processing
    techniques — forming the foundation for my later research in deep learning and generative AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a strong foundation in AI model development, generative systems, and applied computer vision, I am passionate about building scalable,
    and interpretable AI solutions that drive innovation in visual intelligence and generative trustworthiness.
