    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science PhD (USC). My work is on <strong>AI, Computer Vision, and Image Forensics</strong> —
      developing state-space and information-theoretic models for detecting generative image forgeries.

      <li>Ph.D. (USC): Context-Aware Semantic Forgery Detection for biomedical and natural images.</li>
      <li>Interests: SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, Representation Learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I’m broadly interested in understanding how complex, high-dimensional vision systems behave and how to model,
      analyze, and intervene in their internal causal pathways. I focus on generative models and representation learning.
