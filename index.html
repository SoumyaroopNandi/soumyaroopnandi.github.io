    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a recent <strong>Ph.D. graduate in Computer Science</strong> from the <strong>University of Southern California (USC)</strong>, specializing in <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning</strong>. 
      My doctoral research at the <strong>USC Information Sciences Institute</strong> focused on developing <strong>state-space</strong> and <strong>information-theoretic deep learning models</strong> for <em>AI-generated image forgery detection</em>,
      <em>generative model fingerprinting</em>, and <em>vision-language understanding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I bring hands-on experience across the full AI stack — from model design and optimization (<strong>SSMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, GANs, CNNs, Transformers</strong>) 
      to data curation, multimodal learning, and large-scale deployment. My projects bridge vision, language, and generative modeling, with applications in <strong>biomedical imaging</strong>, 
      <strong>digital content integrity</strong>, and <strong>trustworthy AI systems</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in <strong>AI-driven image analysis</strong>, <strong>generative model forensics</strong>, and <strong>visual-language alignment</strong>, spanning forgery detection, 
      diffusion modeling, self-supervised learning, and anomaly detection. 
      My research integrates semantic understanding with low-level artifact reasoning to advance explainable and robust visual intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond academia, I have industry experience at <strong>ABB Robotics</strong> and <strong>ON Semiconductor</strong>, applying computer vision, 3D mapping, and reinforcement learning to real-world automation systems. 
      I also worked at the <strong>Kansas Geological Survey</strong> and the <strong>Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets</strong>, developing signal and image processing pipelines for radar and seismic data. 
      During my <strong>Master’s in Electrical Engineering at the University of Kansas</strong>, my thesis — <em>“Robust Object Tracking and Adaptive Detection for Auto Navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles”</em> — 
      explored object tracking, motion estimation, and adaptive detection using classical computer vision and signal processing techniques, forming the foundation for my later research in deep learning and generative AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a strong foundation in AI model development, generative systems, and applied computer vision, I am passionate about building <strong>scalable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions</strong> that drive 
      innovation in visual intelligence and generative trustworthiness.
