My research focuses on the integrity and trustworthiness of visual content—developing unified, generalizable frameworks for image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) across both natural and biomedical domains. By formulating IMDL as a three-class segmentation problem (pristine/source/target), my work leverages state-space and attention-based architectures to capture long-range duplication patterns efficiently while disentangling genuine self-similarity from manipulations. I also integrate prompt-conditioned inference to align semantic intent with pixel-level localization and construct standardized benchmarks spanning splicing, copy–move, inpainting, and enhancement, supported by a vision–language–guided diffusion pipeline for realistic synthetic forgeries. These contributions advance reproducibility, interpretability, and domain transfer in modern image forensics.
