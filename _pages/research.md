My work explores state-space models, information-theoretic cues, and vision–language alignment for detecting and localizing AI-generated local forgeries (copy-move, splicing, removal).

### Current themes
- **Information-theoretic fingerprints** for generative edits (diffusion/GAN).
- **State-space models (Mamba/SSM)** for long-range spatial reasoning in biomedical images.
- **Vision–language fusion** for modality-aware detection.
